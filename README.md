**Project Title: Mobile App Design System with React Native and Expo-Router Navigation**

**Objective:**
This project embraced the Atomic Design paradigm to create a comprehensive design system for a mobile app. Utilizing React Native and Expo-Router navigation, the goal was to implement a modular and scalable approach to UI development.

**Atomic Design Paradigm Integration:**
1. **Atoms to Pages:**
   - The design system followed the Atomic Design hierarchy, starting with atoms, the smallest UI elements (e.g., buttons, icons), and progressing to molecules (functional units like search bars), organisms (complex sections like headers), templates (layout frameworks), and finally pages (actual screens with real content).

2. **Modularity with React Native:**
   - React Native's component-based architecture seamlessly aligned with the modularity of the Atomic Design paradigm. Each level of the design system corresponded to a specific React Native component, enhancing reusability and maintainability.

3. **Expo-Router Navigation:**
   - Expo-Router navigation facilitated the seamless transition between different levels of the design system. This ensured a smooth flow from individual UI elements (atoms) to higher-level structures (organisms, templates) within the app.

**Methodology:**
1. **Technology Stack:**
   - Leveraged React Native for cross-platform compatibility and Expo-Router for efficient navigation.

2. **Atomic Design Pages:**
   - Created separate pages for each level of the Atomic Design paradigm, allowing for organized development, testing, and updating of individual UI components.

3. **Visualization and Testing:**
   - Utilized React Native's UI capabilities to visualize and test the design system. The app's interface mirrored the Atomic Design hierarchy, providing a visual representation of how each component contributed to the overall user experience.

**Conclusion:**
By integrating the Atomic Design paradigm with React Native and Expo-Router navigation, this mobile app project successfully established a modular and scalable design system. The project's approach allowed for efficient development, testing, and maintenance of UI components at various levels, ensuring a consistent and flexible user interface that can easily adapt to evolving user requirements.
